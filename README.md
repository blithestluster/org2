Org² (Organic Organization)
===========================
Org² is a **progressive evolutionary organizational framework** that aims to help organizations handle new levels of complexity, by developing the three pillars of teal organizations (evolutionary purpose, self-management and wholeness) identified by *Frederic Laloux* in his book *Reinventing Organizations*.

This work is collective effort of anonymous individuals.

Our influences include:
- Reinventing Organizations
- Holacracy and Sociocracy 3.0
- Agile Software Development
- Getting Things Done
- Responsive Organizations

All rules of Org² are described in the [Rule Book](https://github.com/blithestluster/org2/blob/master/game-book.md). 

Implementation tips can be found in the [Rogue Book](https://github.com/blithestluster/org2/blob/master/rogue-book.md).
