Org² (Organic Organization)
===========================
Org² is a **progressive evolutionary organizational framework** that aims to help organizations handle new levels of complexity, by developing the three pillars of teal organizations (evolutionary purpose, self-management and wholeness) identified by *Frederic Laloux* in his book *Reinventing Organizations*.

This work is collective effort of anonymous individuals.

Our influences include:
- Reinventing Organizations
- Holacracy and Sociocracy 3.0
- Agile Software Development
- Getting Things Done
- Responsive Organizations
- Exponential Organizations

Definition of basic terms
--------------------------

Before describing the specific mechanics of the framework, we need to introduce some basic terms: 

**Artifacts**: Practices, elements, rituals and other mechanisms that are used to evolve the organization.

**Stages**: Stages are levels of organizational maturity formed by groups of artifacts.

**Skills**: Core abilities that are vital in an evolutionary organization. Some skills are prerequisites for some stages or practices, whereas others can be developed by living the artifacts.

**Segments**: Different parts of the organization that are living different Stages. 

Power and Authority
-------------------
Organizational power resides only in the artifacts applied to the segments of the organization. Except were noted differently, legacy power structures, like the management hierarchy, do not apply.

Artifacts (apply in a given segment):
-------------------------------------

- Circle Structure
- Roles
- Governance Holder
- Tension Sensor
- Basic Operations
- Open Segment Data
- Work Reflection Sessions
- Artifact Reflection
- Distributed Appraisal (performance, firing)
- Basic Duties (transparency, prioritization, …) 
- Tactical Meeting
- Secretary
- Facilitator
- Outer Link
- Governance Meeting
- Distributed Ownership

Questions
------------
How do I add artifacts to a segment? To add artifacts to a segment of the organization, you need to seek consent of all members of that segment.
