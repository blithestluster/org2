===========

A **Segment** is a team, department or organization where this Game Book is being applied.

**Segment Members** are partners or employees of the organization that are also part of the Segment.

The **Sponsors** are the legacy power holders that hold the space in order to enable this game to happen. They are the ratifiers of this game book.

The **Seeders** are facilitators selected by the Sponsors that are introducing the OrgÂ² framework in segments of the organization.

**Artifacts** are practices, rituals, rules and other mechanics applied to Segments and developed by Seeders in order to evolve the organization meta structures. 

**Consent** means that no one in a given group sees a reason why a change would cause irreversible harm to that group, considering the organizational space only (personal harm does not count). 

Artifacts can only be adopted with the consent of all Segment Members. 

The Sponsors ratify this Game Book in the Segments of the Organization that they hold accoutable for and declare that this rules apply for all Segment Members, including themselves. Nevertheless, they still hold the power to cancel the Game Book and go back to original structure.
